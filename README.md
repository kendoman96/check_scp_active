# check_scp_active
This plugin is used so you can actively monitor your screen SCP session without keeping an active terminal open.
This is useful if you have large network file transfers and want to leave them in a screen session.
This will prevent accidental termination or timeout termination, and still alow you to determine if your transfer is ongoing.
